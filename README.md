# Goals of the Project
The project aims to provide an easy, daily experience to incorporate spiritual discplines. Such features include a calendar on the home page to schedule fasting, devotions, and other disciplines.

"The spiritual disciplines are those practices found in Scripture that promote spiritual growth among believers in the gospel of Jesus Christ. They are habits of devotion, habits of experiential Christianity that have been practiced by Godâ€™s people since biblical times." - desiringgod.org/interviews/what-are-spiritual-disciplines
